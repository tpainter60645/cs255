System analysis and design

Since there are very few tools for driver exam assistance, DriverPass wants to create one. The website will incorporate practice exams, classes, and appointment capability for on the road practice.
I don't think I did anything better than anything else on the projects.
I don't think I would change anything with my work.  I think I was very through with both projects.
Users want a website that is accessible from whatever browser they are using.  They want a site that is secure and easy to use.  They want to be able to track their progress.  All of this was included in the design of the site.
When I design software, I listen to the clients needs and design it around both their needs and the users needs.
